        <p>My slow flow creates a balance between strengthening postures and soothing relaxation. I give  detailed explanations about the anatomy and correct alignment of the poses.

        The class starts with a breathing meditation. Then the asana series releases the tension of the day. We always focus on a specific part of the body and each class is a bit different. Lately I have been teaching chakra-based practices.

        Towards the end the tempo slows down to yin-like seated and reclining postures. The sequences will help you to get rid of the everyday aches and pains. We finish with a relaxing gong meditation, that will put you at complete ease.

        The courseâ€™s main language is English, for request it can be also held in German. It is suitable for all levels.
